This project is a simple REST API for managing user and admin registry details. Built with PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, HTML, and CSS, it facilitates efficient management of user data. Users can view their registry details, while admins have full control to create, update, or delete user information. The combination of PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, and HTML/CSS for the user interface makes the system robust and user-friendly.
